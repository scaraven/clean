@[expose] public section

/-
The purpose of this file is to define a memory model that can be checked using the Memory in the Head paradigm,
often also called "offline memory checking". [Blu+91]

This file roughly aims to prove the following theorem.

Given an ordered list of memory accesses (timestamp, address, readValue, writeValue), where at each access,
we read the current value at the address, and then write a new value to the address, considering that
the initial memory is all zero, then checking the consistency of the memory accesses is equivalent to checking
the following decision procedure:
there exists a permutation of the original list, such that it is sorted first by address and then by timestamp,
 and such that the following property holds for each pair of consecutive elements of this array
  (t2, addr2, readValue2, writeValue2) :: (t1, addr1, readValue1, writeValue1) :: rest
if addr1 = addr2, then readValue2 = writeValue1, and if addr1 ≠ addr2, then readValue2 = 0.
Additionally, the first value of the array (t, addr, readValue, writeValue) must have readValue = 0.

  A memory access consists of an address, a read value, and a write value.
  The semantics are that at this address, we read the readValue, and then write the writeValue.

  Technical lemma for soundness: if there exists two address-timestamp sorted lists of memory accesses
  that are both permutations of the same timestamp-sorted list, then they must be equal.

  Intuition: since the input list is timestamp strictly sorted, then there are no two timestamps in l1
  that are equal, and therefore, for that class of lists, any address-timestamp sorted list is unique.
  (This is true in general, if the initial list contains no duplicates, then any sorting is unique.)
