This file defines a typeclass `FiniteField` that abstracts the properties of finite fields
needed by circuit gadgets. The goal is to provide a common interface that both prime fields
(`ZMod p`) and binary fields (`GF(2^n)`) can satisfy, enabling gadgets to be written
generically over any finite field.

The key abstraction: every finite field element has a canonical embedding into `ℕ`
(for prime fields, this is `ZMod.val`; for binary fields, this interprets the
polynomial coefficients as a binary number). This embedding enables bit decomposition,
range checks, and size-dependent reasoning.

Part of issue #154: Generalize prime field assumption to cover binary fields.

/--
`FiniteField` extends `Field` with a canonical embedding into `ℕ` and finiteness.
This captures the shared structure of prime fields and binary fields that circuit
gadgets rely on: the ability to decompose field elements into bits and reason
about their numeric value.
-/
class FiniteField (F : Type) extends Field F where
  /-- Canonical embedding of field elements into natural numbers. -/
  val : F → ℕ
  /-- Inverse of `val`: interpret a natural number (below the field size) as a field
  element. For prime fields this is `Nat.cast`; for binary fields it interprets the
  binary digits as polynomial coefficients. Note that `Nat.cast` would be wrong there:
  it reduces via the characteristic, collapsing `GF(2^n)` to `{0, 1}`. -/
  fromNat : ℕ → F
  /-- The number of field elements, as a plain `ℕ`. Deliberately NOT via `Fintype`:
  the circuit machinery passes `FiniteField` instances everywhere, and materializing
  a `Fintype`'s `Finset.univ` (2^31 elements for Babybear) at runtime or compile time
  is fatal (out-of-memory). -/
  size : ℕ
  /-- Every element's value is less than the field size. -/
  val_lt : ∀ x : F, val x < size
  /-- The embedding is injective (distinct elements have distinct values). -/
  val_injective : Function.Injective val
  /-- `fromNat` inverts `val` on naturals below the field size. -/
  val_fromNat : ∀ n < size, val (fromNat n) = n
  /-- Zero maps to zero. -/
  val_zero : val 0 = 0
  /-- One maps to one. -/
  val_one : val 1 = 1
