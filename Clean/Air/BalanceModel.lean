# Balance models

A `BalanceModel` packages what a proof-system verifier establishes about the interactions
on one channel, the side conditions the soundness argument needs in addition, the reading
of interactions as bus events, and the two derivations that feed the shared kernel of
`Clean.Air.Balance` (`PullsSupported` and `CountBalanced`).

## An abstract count/support interface

The structure fixes only the shape of the argument. Its `view` is supplied by the model, and
its two kernel derivations are stated relative to that view; nothing in the structure relates
the view to the raw channel contract, `Interaction.Guarantees` and `Interaction.Requirements`.
A model that reads every interaction as an inactive event satisfies every field, and its
`Balanced` then accepts an active receive that no provider supports (see `blindModel` in
`Clean/Air/Test/BusBalance.lean`).

What makes a model usable in a channel soundness argument is a correspondence law for the
encoding it reads, proved separately from this structure: the view recovers the payload,
direction and activity of every evaluated interaction of the channel; the argument is applied
per raw channel, to `interactionsWith channel`; permission to assume the guarantee stays with
`assumeGuarantees`; and `PullsSupported view` transports the requirement of the supporting
provider to the guarantee of the receive. For the directed encoding, the local contract
rejects malformed tags (`DirectedChannel.toRaw`), `DirectedChannel.directedEvent_emittedValue`
is the recovery lemma and `DirectedChannel.guarantees_of_requirements_of_pullsSupported` is
the transport theorem, both below.

## A model only fits the encoding it reads

A model and a channel are chosen independently, and after erasure to `RawChannel` nothing
records which encoding a channel uses. The two mismatched pairings fail differently. The
multiset model applied to a legacy channel strips the last payload element as if it were a
tag and accepts interactions whose messages never matched: a wrong relation that has
witnesses. The LogUp model applied to a directed channel is satisfied only by traces with no
active interaction, because every directed gate is `0` or `1` and nothing cancels: an empty
relation, over which any soundness statement is vacuous.

Two declarations tie a model to its encoding.

* `RawChannel.ConsistentWith model` is the soundness obligation of one channel under a model:
  balance under the model and the requirements of all interactions on the channel imply
  their guarantees. It is the legacy `RawChannel.Consistent` with the model as a parameter,
  it is declared for exactly the two supported pairings, and `FormalEnsembleWith` demands it
  of every channel. Instance search finds it for a correct pairing and for neither mismatch.
  As a proposition it is *false* for the multiset model on a legacy channel whose guarantee
  is refutable (`legacy_not_consistentWith_multiset` in `Clean/Air/Test/BusBalance.lean`),
  but *true* for the LogUp model on every directed channel, whatever the guarantee, precisely
  because that relation admits no active interaction (`directed_consistentWith_logUp`, same
  file). So the obligation alone does not exclude the vacuous pairing; a hand-written
  instance would discharge it.
* `BalanceModel.Reads model Ch` records the typed channel constructor `Ch` whose erasure a
  model reads, with the erasure and the consistency law for it. It has the same two
  instances (`logUp` reads `Channel`, `multiset` reads `DirectedChannel`) and is what the
  model-aware builders (roadmap Layer 3) take channels through, so that a channel of the
  wrong kind is a type error at the line that adds it, not a proposition somebody can prove.
  Custom raw channels enter through the obligation directly.

## The two models

* `BalanceModel.logUp` is today's `BalancedInteractions`, split into its field-sum relation
  and its no-wrap guard, under the legacy sign reading of direction
  (`Interaction.legacyEvent`). Its `Balanced` predicate is `BalancedInteractions` by
  definition, so the legacy ensemble statement is the LogUp instance of the model-aware one.
* `BalanceModel.multiset` is the permutation of active provided and received payloads under
  the directed reading (`Interaction.directedEvent`) of `DirectedChannel` interactions. It
  has no side condition and no characteristic bound.

The model-aware ensemble entry points (`Ensemble.StatementWith` and friends) take the model
explicitly. There is deliberately no default model instance: a user of a characteristic-2
field has to name the model, and cannot pick LogUp by omission.

A balance model: the per-channel relation a verifier establishes, the side conditions the
soundness argument needs, the reading of interactions as events, and the derivations of the
kernel facts.

The split between `Verified` and `SideCondition` is what leaves room for a capacity premise
(Clean issue #452): an ensemble-wide bound computed by the verifier can be bridged to the
per-channel `SideCondition` of the LogUp model without touching the multiset model.

## The directed reading

A `DirectedChannel` interaction stores its direction as the last message element; see
`Clean.Circuit.DirectedChannel`. The directed reading recovers payload and direction from
there. An interaction whose last element is not the provide tag is read as a receive, so
that a malformed tag can never play the role of a provider.

The multiset model: active provided and received payloads are a permutation of each other, in
the directed reading. No side condition and no characteristic bound.

Its `UnitEvent` is the boolean-gate discipline: one interaction is one event when its gate is
`0` or `1`. The relation does not depend on it (a gate of `2` reads as one active event, and the
local contract of a directed channel is what rejects it), so it changes nothing the model
accepts; it records the discipline under which the count derivation may be invoked, and the VM
adapter (`Clean.Air.VmWith`) supplies it from the boolean gate that every directed interaction
owes.

## The VM argument on a directed channel
-/

namespace DirectedChannel
/--
The VM argument for a directed channel, over any field: the directed counterpart of
`guarantees_of_requirements_of_requirements_of_guarantees`. Given the receives `pulls` and the
provides `pushes` of a channel's rows, paired by index, count balance on their concatenation
(which the multiset model derives from its relation), and the per-row implications
`G pulls[i] → R pushes[i]`, every row also satisfies the converse. The kernel does the
induction; this theorem supplies the count equality (`count_eq_of_countBalanced`) and the
bridge from a provide's requirement to a receive's guarantee on the same payload.

`pulls_receive` is load-bearing: a provide among the pulls supplies a receive among the pulls
without any row owing its guarantee (`pull_role_necessary` in the tests). `pushes_provide` is
what the count-equality step consumes; a receive among the pushes would be matched by a
provide among the pushes whose guarantee no pull needs, so the statement itself does not
depend on it, but that argument is not the kernel's induction. It is kept so that the theorem
is an instance of the kernel, and is flagged for review.

## Consistency of a channel under a model

/--
A raw channel is consistent under a balance model if, for any interactions on that channel,
balance under the model together with the requirements of all interactions implies the
guarantees of all interactions: what the receivers assumed is justified by what the providers
proved. This is the legacy `RawChannel.Consistent` with the model as a parameter.

It is the obligation that ties a model to the encoding it reads. It mentions no circuit: it
relates the channel's two predicates, the model's reading and the model's relation.

The typed channel constructor whose erasure a balance model reads, with the erasure and the

through `toRaw` cannot be handed a channel of another kind: for a mismatched pairing there is
no instance, so the call is a type error at the line that adds the channel. This is the static
tie between models and channel kinds. `RawChannel.ConsistentWith` alone is not, since it is
provable for the LogUp model on every directed channel.

/--
A formal ensemble whose soundness proof is bound to an explicit balance model.

`consistent` is the per-channel soundness obligation under the model. Instances exist for
legacy channels under `logUp` and for directed channels under `multiset`, so for a correct
pairing the field is found by instance search (`fun _ _ => inferInstance` after a case split
on the channel list), and instance search finds nothing for either mismatch. It is not a proof
that the model reads the channels' encoding: the multiset model on a legacy channel with a
refutable guarantee makes it false, but the LogUp model on a directed channel makes it true
for every guarantee, since that relation is met only by inactive traces, and a bundle built by
hand for that pairing has a vacuous `soundness`. The model-aware builders avoid this by taking
typed channels through `BalanceModel.Reads`; a bundle assembled by hand should come with a
satisfiability witness for its statement.
