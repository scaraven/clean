# Bus balance acceptance tests

Evidence for the acceptance items of the bus-balance roadmap that are within reach of the
kernel and the balance models (A1–A6, A11, A13–A15, A17–A18), the legacy compatibility
fixtures, and the Layer 0 prototype: one typed message, a provider, a receive with an
assumption, a receive without an assumption, a gated event, and one ensemble whose statement
takes an explicit balance model. The Consistency section shows what a balance model does on
the channel encoding it reads, what it does on the other one, and which pairings the
consistency obligation and the static tie `BalanceModel.Reads` admit.

Two kinds of fixture are kept apart. An `example` whose type is `Prop` only checks that the
new API elaborates with explicit parameters; it proves nothing about satisfiability. Every
semantic claim in this file (what the legacy relation admits over `F 2`, what the local
contract rejects, what a model accepts, what a nested circuit collects) is a proved statement
or a `#guard`.

/-- A14, typechecking test: the model-aware statement is stated over any field with an
explicit model; there is no default instance to fall back to. The `Prop` is not proved. -/

    (model : BalanceModel F) (ens : Ensemble F PublicIO) (publicInput : PublicIO F) : Prop :=

/-- A14, typechecking test: the multiset model is one such explicit model, over any field. -/

/-- `BalanceModel` is an abstract count/support interface: a model that reads every
interaction as an inactive event satisfies every field. Nothing in the structure relates
`view` to the raw channel contract. -/

/-- So the interface alone does not reject a lone active receive that no provider supports,
although its raw guarantee (`message = 1`, for payload `0`) is false. Ruling this out is the
job of the correspondence law of the reading a model uses: for the directed reading,
`DirectedChannel.directedEvent_emittedValue` ties the view to the evaluated interactions of
the channel and `DirectedChannel.guarantees_of_requirements_of_pullsSupported` transports the
requirement of the supporting provider to the guarantee of the receive. That law lives
outside the structure. -/
