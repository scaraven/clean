/-- Heads tagged with this attribute are semantic circuit constructors for explicit inference.
`infer_explicit_circuits` may unfold user wrappers around circuits, but it must not unfold these heads
because doing so destroys the shape used by explicit instances and loop dispatch. -/
register_label_attr explicit_circuit_no_unfold

/-- Type constructors tagged with this attribute classify declarations that reduced explicit inference
may unfold: a declaration is a candidate when its result type has one of these heads. -/
register_label_attr explicit_circuit_unfold_type

/-- `from_*` lemmas tagged with this attribute are the `ExplicitCircuit` constructors that
`infer_explicit_circuit` dispatches to.  The tactic reads each tagged lemma's conclusion
`ExplicitCircuit <circuit>`, keys it by the head constant of `<circuit>` (e.g. `Bind.bind`,
`Pure.pure`, `Circuit.forEach`, `subcircuit`), and applies the matching lemma directly instead
of trying each by `apply`.  Register a new circuit constructor by tagging its `from_*` lemma. -/
